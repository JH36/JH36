- 👋 Hi y'all! I’m Jennifer Holmes, you can call me Jenn! I'm a bioinformatician at University Hospitals in Cleveland and I love working with WGS & NGS, proteomics, plant genomics and machine learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Nextflow, Snakemake, Django, PostgreSQL, HTML and SQL
- 👩‍💻 Programming Languages I love: R, Perl, Python, C++, C#, C, and Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing pipelines to make WGS and NGS easier and allow for easier integration! I've worked with bacteria, plants, viruses and cancer - I enjoy the challenge of creating visualizations and pipelines to help others enjoy data and learn about bioinformatics/computational biology.
- 🌽 Ask me about: Plant Genomics, Plant WGS/NGS proteomics, Visualizations (Example: Circos, Nextstrain)
